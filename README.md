# RoguelikeDevTutorial
My game made for the 2021 version of r/RoguelikeDev's  RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial (https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o5x585/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/)

I wanted to pracice my Lua still and try out LOVE some, so I decided to do a loose interpretation of the tutorial while translating it into LOVE.

<br />
TO RUN THE GAME:

*Requires a 64 Bit version of Windows*

<br />

***If you want a shortcut:***

Go into the LOVE directory and make a Shortcut to love.exe, then change the target so it is along the lines of:

Target: "D:\Desktop\Folder Name Here\LOVE\love.exe" "D:\Desktop\Folder Name Here\Game"

Start in: "D:\Desktop\Folder Name Here\LOVE"

Folder Name Here is just a placeholder for whatever you name the directory when you extract the .zip file containing everything.

<br />
***If you want to use a terminal***

Open your terminal in the LOVE subdirctory, then use the command

love.exe ..\Game
